  The best way to find out what you do best is to do it. Swing a bat. Pitch a
  tent. Build a pinewood derby® car. Cub Scouts are at that magical age where
  everything is new and possible and, most important, fun. They live in a world
  of “firsts”—first home run, first campfire, first checkered flag—where their
  game plan is their imagination. Their most valuable reward is the friends they
  make for life and a parent’s proud smile. These are invaluable experiences
  that can be had in Scouting. These are life lessons that transform today’s Cub
  Scouts into tomorrow’s Boy Scouts.

## Cub Scouts: Do Your Best. Have Fun Doing It.

The best way to find out what you do best is to do it. Swing a bat. Pitch a tent. Build a pinewood derby(r) car. Cub Scouts are at that magical age where everything is new and possible and, most important, fun. They live in a world of "firsts"---first home run, first campfire, first checkered flag---where their game plan is their imagination. Their most valuable reward is the friends they make for life and a parent's proud smile. These are invaluable experiences that can be had in Scouting. These are life lessons that transform today's Cub Scouts into tomorrow's Boy Scouts.
