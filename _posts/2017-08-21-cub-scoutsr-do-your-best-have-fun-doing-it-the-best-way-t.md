  Cub Scouts®. Do Your Best. Have Fun Doing It.

  The best way to find out what you do best is to do it. Swing a bat. Pitch a
  tent. Build

  a pinewood derby® car. Cub Scouts are at that magical age where everything is
  new

  and possible and, most important, fun. They live in a world of “firsts”—first
  home run,

  first campfire, first checkered flag—where their game plan is their
  imagination.

  Their most valuable reward is the friends they make for life and a parent’s
  proud smile.

  These are invaluable experiences that can be had in Scouting. These are life
  lessons

  that transform today’s Cub Scouts into tomorrow’s Boy Scouts.

Cub Scouts(r). Do Your Best. Have Fun Doing It.
The best way to find out what you do best is to do it. Swing a bat. Pitch a tent. Build
a pinewood derby(r) car. Cub Scouts are at that magical age where everything is new
and possible and, most important, fun. They live in a world of "firsts"---first home run,
first campfire, first checkered flag---where their game plan is their imagination.
Their most valuable reward is the friends they make for life and a parent's proud smile.
These are invaluable experiences that can be had in Scouting. These are life lessons
that transform today's Cub Scouts into tomorrow's Boy Scouts.
